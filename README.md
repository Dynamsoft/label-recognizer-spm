# Dynamsoft Label Recognizer

Dynamsoft Label Recognizer (DLR) is a data capture SDK designed to recognize meaningful zonal text or symbols in an image (or a 'Label' in this context). Some common scenarios where a component like DLR can prove handy include passport MRZ, ID cards, price tags in supermarkets, inventory labels in warehouses, VIN codes on car windshields, driver licenses, and more.
